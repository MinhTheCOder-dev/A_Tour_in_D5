                    <h3>Quick summary</h3>
                    <p>Although not as well-known and popular as the War Remnants Museum, the Southern Women's Museum holds certain values that will surely meet your expectations. It is the themes about women in war that makes it distinctive from other conventional museums. Overall, I would highly recommend it to those who are curious about the Vietnam War, especially about women's role in that war.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>Before diving into my detailed review, let me introduce a little bit about the history of this museum. The museum was originally a private mansion, which belonged to Nguyen Ngoc Lan, a senior officer of the Republic of Vietnam (before 1975). Then, in 1985, the Southern Women's Traditional House with a modest area of 200 square meters. By 1986, it had been expanded to almost 30 times and became the so-called Southern Women’s Museum.        </p>
                    <p>Though the museum had changed considerably, I’m still impressed by the “ancient” beauty of it.</p>

                    <h3>First impression</h3>
                        <p>Arrived at the museum, what comes right into my eye is a statue of a women holding a towel, which I was told that it symbolizes the heroic - resilient - faithful and kind-hearted - capable and diligent qualities of Southern women. A little triggered, isn’t it?</p>
                        <p>There’s also a small house opposite the statue exhibiting mostly pictures of “Heroic Mother of Vietnam” (a.k.a famous Southern women) and a few tools being used in the war, such as boats, etc.</p>
                        <p>I like the way the owner of this museum has kindly provided us with a guide map with one straightforward route to simplify the journey.</p>

                    <h3>Inside the museum</h3>
                    <p><b>Setting:</b> The museum has a setting like a fusion of antique and modern elements, which I appreciate as it can help prevent tourists from being monotonous when entering this museum.</p>
                    <p>The museum houses <strong>11 permanent thematic exhibitions</strong>, including:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Southern women in the armed forces</li>
                        <li>Southern women in diplomatic work</li>
                        <li>Southern women in colonial and imperialist prisons
                        </li>
                        <li>The belief in worshiping the Goddess</li>
                        <li>Costumes and jewelry of ethnic women in Southern Vietnam</li>
                        <li>Traditional hand-weaving crafts</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each section consists of its very unique exhibits, such as pictures of deceased women, tools they used to fight or live secretly, etc                </p>
                    <p>The museum also dedicates two exhibition rooms to simulating the revolutionary activities of women who have made their mark in the history of Vietnam and the world, such as Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai, Lê Thị Hồng Gấm, Võ Thị Sáu, Nguyễn Thị Định, etc. I don’t have any words to say but admire these heroes so much; if I were in that situation, I believed I couldn’t do anything as well as them! They’re so inspiring.</p>

                    <h3>3D display</h3>
                    <p>The second floor of the museum is where the 3D hologram technology being set up. These projectors recreate a vivid images and videos of past events, allowing me to better imagine the past lives of Southern Women. This is one of the most compelling reasons that made me visit the Southern Women's Museum to explore.</p>
