                        <h3>Quick summary</h3>
                        <p>Although not as well-known and popular as the War Remnants Museum, the Southern Women's Museum holds certain values that will surely meet your expectations. It is the themes about women in war that makes it distinctive from other conventional museums. Overall, I would highly recommend it to those who are curious about the Vietnam War, especially about women's role in that war.</p>

                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>Before diving into my detailed review, let me introduce a little bit about the history of this museum. The museum was originally a private mansion, which belonged to Nguyen Ngoc Lan, a senior officer of the Republic of Vietnam (before 1975). Then, in 1985, the Southern Women's Traditional House with a modest area of 200 square meters. By 1986, it had been expanded to almost 30 times and became the so-called Southern Women’s Museum.        </p>
                        <p>Though the museum had changed considerably, I’m still impressed by the “ancient” beauty of it.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>First impression</h3>
                            <p>Arrived at the museum, what comes right into my eye is a statue of a women holding a towel, which I was told that it symbolizes the heroic - resilient - faithful and kind-hearted - capable and diligent qualities of Southern women. A little triggered, isn’t it?</p>
                            <p>There’s also a small house opposite the statue exhibiting mostly pictures of “Heroic Mother of Vietnam” (a.k.a famous Southern women) and a few tools being used in the war, such as boats, etc.</p>
                            <p>I like the way the owner of this museum has kindly provided us with a guide map with one straightforward route to simplify the journey.</p>

                        <h3>Inside the museum</h3>
                        <p><b>Setting:</b> The museum has a setting like a fusion of antique and modern elements, which I appreciate as it can help prevent tourists from being monotonous when entering this museum.</p>

                        <p>The museum also dedicates two exhibition rooms to simulating the revolutionary activities of women who have made their mark in the history of Vietnam and the world, such as Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai, Lê Thị Hồng Gấm, Võ Thị Sáu, Nguyễn Thị Định, etc. I don’t have any words to say but admire these heroes so much; if I were in that situation, I believed I couldn’t do anything as well as them! They’re so inspiring.</p>

This is one of the most compelling reasons that made me visit the Southern Women's Museum to explore.</p>

                            <h3>Quick summary</h3>
                            <p>Visiting Tan Dinh Church in Ho Chi Minh City was one of the most memorable experiences that I had ever had. Its stunning architecture, peaceful ambiance, and friendly locals make it a number-one destination on the list for anyone in Ho Chi Minh City. If you're seeking a place to unwind from the city's chaos, or merely worshipping, Tan Dinh Church is a strong recommendation I would give to you!</p>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Architecture and Atmosphere</h3>
                            <p>The first thing that impress me about Tan Dinh Church is its unique Neo-Gothic design, reflecting in the architecture itself. Also, the pink color makes it stand out among other nearby buildings. Thus, I find it easy to get my attention. In fact, it was painted yellowish before 1975. After several refurbishments, the color has been changed to pink. The distinct pink tones, along with the diamond-shaped dome architecture and the intricate carved details, altogether create a magnificent, ancient structure in the middle of the district 3.</p>
                            <p>There is a main tower with a crucifix on the top. Gazing up from the ground, I can feel that as if this tower touches the clouds. So tall I couldn’t imagine!</p>

                        <li>
                            <h3>What’s inside?</h3>
                            <p>The Basilica is such a beautiful and sacred place. The two strong rows of columns, gives the hall a really stunning look. I’m surprised by the Italian altars inside the church, whose purpose in life is to bring bright sights to the whole hall.</p>
                            <p>On the left and right sides, there are statues of female and male saints. Inside the tower, there’s an complex carved painting, and there are also five bells that weigh around 5.5 tons. </p>
                            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-fist"></i><strong>Walking into the Basilica make me feel like stepping into a dreamy place, almost like you’re in a charming Italian city!!!</strong></p>
