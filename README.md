# A_Tour_in_D5
Project Overview
This project is a TOURISTIC WEBSITE, developed as part of my school curriculum. As the sole coder, I designed and implemented the website to attract customers and users. The project features the attractions, food, and traveling tips for foreigners visiting District 3, Ho Chi Minh city . I utilized technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which allowed me to enhance my skills in web development and problem-solving. You can view the live project here.

The other members gather information and pictures for the project. More information is available in the credit page.
